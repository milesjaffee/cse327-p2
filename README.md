# CSE 327 P2

This **PDDL-based project** was completed for Jeff Heflin's CSE327 in Spring '25 at Lehigh University.

There are two main classes (**EvalCargo** and **EvalPlanTowers**), which both use the provided PDDL forward state space planning library to get solutions to unique problems - a logistics problem involving planes carrying cargos between airports and the classic Towers of Hanoi problem for three disks.
